refactor the notes into cards
    categories in the side bar (frontend, backend, misc) when clicked on bring up all cards from their categories 
        Create routes
- remove sidebar. add nav to header. notes are now routes. each page has additional resources in a sidebar.

I'd like a home page that displays all notes by default
    Add favorites function that moves notes to the front of the line

Make this responsive so i can view on mobile

Add matrix to header
Fix margin on main title

bug crawl around screen for dev easter egg

move todo to a separate icon outside of aside
