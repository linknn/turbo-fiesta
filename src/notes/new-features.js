refactor the notes into cards
    categories in the side bar (frontend, backend, misc) when clicked on bring up all cards from their categories 
        Create routes
- remove sidebar. add nav to header. notes are now routes. each page has additional resources in a sidebar.

I'd like a home page that displays all notes by default
    Add favorites function that moves notes to the front of the line

Make this responsive so i can view on mobile

Add matrix to header
Fix margin on main title

bug crawl around screen for dev easter egg

emoji for todo isnt centered and give it some hover effects

change out all colors for root names for future theme changes
    find a way to have it rotate through themes based on time of year?
