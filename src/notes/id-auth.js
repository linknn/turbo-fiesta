Identification: some kind of value given to something to distinguish it
Authentication: checking that the value and what it was given to are accurate
Authorization: giving permissions to that value once authenticated

Saying your name is identification
Showing your id is authentication of who you are
Based on that authentication ( showing id ) authorization is given because of the information on it
    Or like when you sign up for socials and confirm your email, authorization now lets you edit your profile


id: place an order with phone/name/email
authen:
author: show id to get package, use qr to pickup; cop asks for id
